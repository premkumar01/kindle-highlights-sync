That’s one thing I tell patients who are in the midst of crippling depression, the kind that makes them think, There’s the bathroom. It’s about five feet away. I see it, but I can’t get there. One foot, then the other. Don’t look at all five feet at once. Just take a step. And when you’ve taken that step, take one more. Eventually you’ll make it to the shower. And you’ll make it to tomorrow and next year too. One step. They may not be able to imagine their depression lifting anytime soon, but they don’t need to. Doing something prompts you to do something else, replacing a vicious cycle with a virtuous one.

I believe the significant number of Nice Guys produced in the40s, '50s, and 60s is the direct result of mothers, not fathers, teaching their sons how to be male. Consequently, many Nice Guys have adopted a female perspective of masculinity and are comfortable having their manhood defined by women.

«soft males.» He writes, «they’re lovely, valuable people —I like them— they’re not interested in harming the earth or starting wars. There’s a gentle attitude toward life in their whole being and style of living. But many of these men are not happy. You quickly notice the lack of energy in them. They are life-preserving but not exactly life-giving. Ironically, you often see these men with strong women who positively radiate energy. Here we have a finely-tuned young man, ecologically superior to his father, sympathetic to the whole harmony of the universe, yet he himself has little vitality to offer.»

Seeking women’s approval requires Nice Guys to constantly monitor the possibility of a woman’s availability. The possibility of availability is a term I use to describe the subjective measure of a woman’s sexual availability. Since Nice Guys see sex as the ultimate form of acceptance, and they believe a woman must be in a good mood before she will have sex, these men are constantly diligent to not do anything that might upset a woman whom they desire. In addition, if a woman they desire is angry, depressed, or in a bad mood, they believe they must do something quickly —lie, offer solutions, sacrifice self, manipulate— to fix it.

Seeking women’s approval creates rage toward women. Though most Nice Guys claim to «love» women, the truth is, most of these men have tremendous rage toward women. This is because we tend to eventually despise whatever we make into our god. When our god fails to respond in the ways we expect, we humans tend to respond in one of two ways.

Walls Nice Guys build walls that prevent others from getting too close. Understandably, this affects their ability to be intimate, but it also protects them from the consequences of being found out. These walls might include: Addictions (food, sex, t.v., alcohol, work, etc.), humor, sarcasm, intellectualism, perfectionism, and isolation.

Like most Nice Guy patterns, these unconscious behaviors actually accomplish the exact opposite of what the Nice Guy really craves. While desiring love and connection, his behaviors serve as an invisible force field that keeps people from being able to get close to him. Nice Guys have a difficult time comprehending that in general, people are not drawn to perfection in others. People are drawn to shared interests, shared problems, and an individual’s life energy. Humans connect with humans. Hiding one’s humanity and trying to project an image of perfection makes a person vague, slippery, lifeless, and uninteresting. I often refer to Nice Guys as Teflon Men. They work so hard to be smooth, nothing can stick to them. Unfortunately, this Teflon coating also makes it difficult for people to get close. It is actually a person’s rough edges and human imperfections that give others something to connect with.

Self-Approval Recovery from the Nice Guy Syndrome involves changing core paradigms. Instead of seeking external validation and avoiding disapproval, recovering Nice Guys must begin seeking the approval of the only person who really matters —themselves. Ironically, when Nice Guys begin focusing on pleasing themselves, they actually begin to experience the intimacy and connection with others that they have always desperately craved. To help facilitate this recovery process, Nice Guys can: Identify how they seek approval. Take good care of themselves. Give themselves positive affirmations. Spend extended periods of time alone. Reveal themselves to safe people.

As they become aware of how much time and energy they spend trying to garner approval, they can begin living an inside-out kind of life. This means, rather than focusing outward for acceptance and approval, they turn inward. In doing so, they can begin asking themselves the important questions: «What do I want,» «What feels right to me,» «What would make me happy?»

Go back to the list of approval-seeking behaviors at the beginning of this chapter. Choose one of the ways you try to get external validation and do one of the following: Go on a moratorium from this behavior. Set a period of time to stop doing it. Tell the people around you what you are doing. If you slip, tell a safe person about it. Use the slip as information about why, in that particular moment, you felt the need to get external approval. Consciously do more of this behavior. This may not make logical sense, but it is a powerful way to explore any dysfunctional behavior. Observe how you feel when you consciously try harder to get external validation.

I strongly recommend that Nice Guys take trips and retreats by themselves to places where no one knows them.

I suggest that the recovering Nice Guy set a regular time to meet with his safe person or group, and a little at a time, start revealing himself. This process begins by just talking about himself. This in itself makes many Nice Guys uncomfortable. Over time, the recovering Nice Guy can begin revealing the things about himself that he is the least comfortable letting others see.

One of the most common ways Nice Guys use covert contracts to try to meet their needs is through caretaking. Nice Guys believe their caretaking is fundamentally loving and is one of the things that makes them good people. In reality, caretaking has nothing to do with being loving or good. Caretaking is an immature and indirect attempt to try to get one’s needs met. Caretaking always consists of two parts: Focusing on another’s problems, needs, or feelings in order to Feel valuable, get one’s own needs met, or to avoid dealing with one’s own problems or feelings.

Caring Vs. Caretaking Though Nice Guys see everything they do for others as loving, caretaking has very little to do with caring. Here are the differences: Caretaking Gives to others what the giver needs to give. Comes from a place of within emptiness within the giver. Always has unconscious strings attached. Caring Gives to others what the receiver needs. Comes from a place of abundance the the giver. Has no strings attached.

The Victim Triangle Rather than helping Nice Guys meet their needs, covert contracts and caretaking only lead to frustration and resentment. When this frustration and resentment builds long enough, it often spills out in some not so pretty ways. Giving to get creates a cycle of craziness called the victim triangle. The victim triangle consists of three predictable sequences: The Nice Guy gives to others hoping to get something in return. When it doesn’t seem that he is getting as much as he gives or he isn’t getting what he expected, he feels frustrated and resentful. Remember, the Nice Guy is the one keeping score and he isn’t totally objective. When this frustration and resentment builds up long enough, it spills out in the form of rage attacks, passive-aggressive behavior, pouting, tantrums, withdrawing, shaming, criticizing, blaming, even physical abuse. Once the cycle has been completed, it usually just begins all over again.

When Nice Guys are learning to tell the truth I encourage them to pay attention to the things they least want others to know, what they least want to reveal. These are the things they are most likely to hold back —and the things they most need to tell.

Boundaries are essential for survival. Learning to set boundaries allows Nice Guys to stop feeling like helpless victims and reclaim their personal power. Boundary setting is one of the most fundamental skills I teach to recovering Nice Guys.

Due to their childhood conditioning, they teach the people around them that they will accept having their boundaries violated. As recovering Nice Guys begin to take responsibility for how they let people treat them, their own behavior begins to change. As they stop reinforcing things they aren’t willing to tolerate, the people around them are given the opportunity to behave differently. This gives relationships a chance to survive and grow.

In fact, Wendell continues, I’ve lost more than my relationship in the present. I’ve lost my relationship in the future. We tend to think that the future happens later, but we’re creating it in our minds every day. When the present falls apart, so does the future we had associated with it. And having the future taken away is the mother of all plot twists. But if we spend the present trying to fix the past or control the future, we remain stuck in place, in perpetual regret. By Google-stalking Boyfriend, I’ve been watching his future unfold while I stay frozen in the past. But if I live in the present, I’ll have to accept the loss of my future.

Before you can start setting boundaries, you have to become aware of how much you back up from your line to avoid conflict or to keep the peace. For the next week, observe yourself. Do you say «yes» when you would rather say «no»? Do you agree to do something to avoid conflict? Do you avoid doing something because someone might get upset at you? Do you tolerate an intolerable situation, hoping that it will just go away? Write these observations down and share them with a safe person.

Men born after World War II had the misfortune of growing up during the only era of recent western history in which it was not always a good thing to be male. This was primarily the result of two significant family and social changes in the post war era: 1) boys were disconnected from their fathers and other healthy male role models, and 2) boys were forced to seek approval from women and accept a female definition of what it meant to be male.

The ones who refused were cursed that they would never be kings, and this includes the Yadavas (descended from Yadu). The one who agreed was Puru and the lunar dynasty continued through him. Puru’s son Duhshanta was made famous by Kalidasa in the Duhshanta–Shakuntala story and their son was Bharata, contributing to the name of Bharatavarsha.

For my mother, it was being an active parent. Right from the start, she had an intuitive sense of my needs. She gave me space to make my own decisions and I learned how to take ownership of my life. She helped remove any obstacles in my way and helped me grow into a confident adult. At every step of my journey, the courage to take the next step was a direct result of her abundant love and compassion. My father prioritized work. I struggled with this for many years. I wished he was around more. As I got older, however, I realized that this decision was just as hard on him and that he didn’t have any other choice.

According to Callard, people on aspirational journeys, or what I call the pathless path, are “characteristically needy people.” Because their worldviews are incomplete and evolving, they are dependent on the support of other people.

The 85 Percent Solution: Getting started is more important than becoming an expert. Too many of us get overwhelmed thinking we need to manage our money perfectly, which leads us to do nothing at all. That’s why the easiest way to manage your money is to take it one step at a time—and not worry about being perfect. I’d rather act and get it 85 percent right than do nothing. Think about it: 85 percent of the way is far better than zero percent. Once your money system is good enough—or 85 percent of the way there—you can get on with your life and go do the things you really want to do.

Finally, if you find that, no matter how you run the numbers, you’re not going to be able to pay your loan off in any reasonable amount of time, it’s time to call your lender. Look at the phone number on that monthly bill you keep ignoring. Call them up and ask them for their advice. I can’t emphasize this enough: Call them. Your lenders have heard it all, from “I can’t pay this month” to “I have five different loans and want to consolidate them.” You’ll want to ask them the following: ■ “What would happen if I paid $100 more per month?” (Substitute in the right amount for you.)

In the standard method, you pay the minimums on all cards, but pay more money to the card with the highest APR, because it’s costing you the most. In the Dave Ramsey snowball method, you pay the minimums on all cards, but pay more money to the card with the lowest balance first—the one that will allow you to pay it off first.

Remember the philosophy behind the 85 Percent Solution: The goal is not to research every last corner to decide where the money will come from; it’s action. Figure out how much debt you have, decide how you want to pay it down, negotiate your rates, and get started. You can always fine-tune your plan and amount later.

Being in debt means giving up choices, means staying at a job you hate because it pays good money, means not being able to build a decent savings account. My biggest mistake was not thinking about the future and using credit cards to live beyond my means. I got myself into debt in my midtwenties by spending, spending, spending—and on stupid things like clothes, eating out, movies, etc. I learned my lesson and am now living within my means on a strict budget that will allow me to be debt-free in two years. All of my debt is now on cards with APRs between zero and 4.99 percent. I have a small but growing savings account, a 401(k), and a plan to achieve financial freedom. —Melissa Brown, 28

Let’s first dispense with the idea that saying no to spending on certain things means you’re cheap. If you decide that spending $2.50 on Cokes when you eat out isn’t worth it—and you’d rather save that $15 each week for a movie—that’s not being cheap. That’s consciously deciding what you value. Unfortunately, most Americans were never taught how to consciously spend, which means cutting costs mercilessly on the things you don’t love, but spending extravagantly on the things you do.

This is how index funds (a cousin of mutual funds) are run. These funds work by replacing portfolio managers with computers. The computers don’t attempt to find the hottest stock. They simply and methodically pick the same stocks that an index holds—for example, the five hundred stocks in the S&P 500—in an attempt to match the market. (An index is a way to measure part of the stock market. For example, the NASDAQ index represents certain technology stocks, while the S&P 500 represents five hundred large US stocks. There are international indexes and even retail indexes.)

if you’re thinking about using a broker or actively managed fund, call them and ask them a simple, point-blank question: “What were your after-tax, after-fee returns for the last ten, fifteen, and twenty years?” Yes, their response must include all fees and taxes. Yes, the return period must be at least ten years, because the last five years of any time period are too volatile to matter. And yes, I promise they won’t give you a straight answer, because that would be admitting that they didn’t beat the market consistently. It’s that hard to do.

Bonds are essentially IOUs from companies or the government. (Technically, bonds are longer-term investments of ten-plus years, whereas certificates of deposits, or CDs, involve lending money to a bank. Because they’re very similar, let’s just call them both bonds to simplify things.) If you buy a one-year bond, it’s the same as if the bank says, “Hey, if you lend us $100, we’ll give you $103 back a year from now.”

is important to diversify within stocks, but it’s even more important to allocate across the different asset classes—like stocks and bonds. Investing in only one category is dangerous over the long term. This is where the all-important concept of asset allocation comes into play. Remember it like this: Diversification is D for going deep into a category (for example, buying different types of stocks: large-cap, small-cap, international, and so on), and asset allocation is A for going across all categories (for example, stocks and bonds).

Age and risk tolerance matter. If you’re twenty-five years old and have dozens of years to grow your money, a portfolio made up of mostly stock-based funds probably makes sense. But if you’re older, retirement is coming up within a few decades and you’ll want to tamp down your risk. Even if the market tanks, you have control over your asset allocation. If you’re older—especially if you’re in your sixties or older, for god’s sake—a sizable portion of your portfolio should be in stable bonds.

The Rule of 72 is a fast trick you can do to figure out how long it will take to double your money. Here’s how it works: Divide the number 72 by the return rate you’re getting, and you’ll have the number of years you must invest in order to double your money. (For the math geeks among us, here’s the equation: 72 ÷ return rate = number of years.) For example, if you’re getting a 10 percent return rate from an index fund, it would take you a little more than seven years (72 divided by 10) to double your money. In other words, if you invested $5,000 today, let it sit there, and earned a 10 percent return, you’d have $10,000 in about seven years. And it doubles from there, too. Of course, you could accumulate even more using the power of compounding by adding more every month.

At this level, you’ve already won the introductory game. Now it’s time to ask why you want to keep going. If the answer is, “I want to take a lavish vacation every year and splurge on first-class tickets,” great! If your answer is, “I’m saving aggressively for the next three years so we can afford to move into our dream neighborhood,” awesome. I can show you how to achieve both of those goals even faster. To do that, let’s go through an exercise I call “Taking It From the Clouds to the Street.” When I ask you, “Why do you want more?” the common answers are “freedom” or “security.” Those are fine, but I want to challenge you to go deeper. The problem is that high-level, vague visions never motivate us as much as we’d hope. True motivation is often real, concrete—on the street. It’s something that affects our day-to-day.

To put it another way, if you found a magical money machine that took $1 in and spit $5 out, what would you do? You’d put as much as you could in it! The only catch is, it takes time: Every dollar you invest today will be worth many more tomorrow.

tempting to tinker with online calculators and asset allocations for years and years, but at a certain point—especially for my readers who have followed my lessons and automated their money—there’s a point where you got it right. You won the game. Now it just takes time, patience, and feeding the system. The next layer of a Rich Life isn’t about recalculating your returns from compound interest. It’s about designing the lifestyle you want. Kids? Taking a two-month vacation every year? Flying your parents out to meet you? Increasing your savings rate so you can retire in your forties?

As you become more financially successful, your relationships with others might change. Be aware of it. (For example, I’m hyperconscious about different people’s ability to spend on a dinner or vacation. If I’m meeting a group of friends for dinner, I’ll always pick a restaurant that we can all easily afford. My nightmare is choosing a place that makes them feel financially pressured.)

Check your credit score. The higher your score, the better the interest rate on your mortgage will be. If your credit score is low, it might be a better decision to delay buying until you can improve your score.
